		<h2>Terminology</h2>
		<p>The table below provides information on some terms and
			definitions used in the Vidiun open source video platform, and in
			any relevant documentation.</p>
		<table id="terminology">
			<colgroup>
				<col class="name" />
			</colgroup>
			<tr>
				<th class="title">Term</th>
				<th class="title">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td><a href="#entry">Entry</a></td>
				<td>An entry is a media entity and its meta-data on the Vidiun
					servers. It can be an image, a sound clip, a video file or a
					rough-cut (explained below) wrapped with vast information such as
					dates, titles, tags, ratings and more. The Vidiun extensive API
					enables its partners to create galleries, lists, playlists and more
					by calling up various entry-related API calls as well as edit this
					information on the fly.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Rough-cut</td>
				<td>A rough-cut is a 'mix' type entry. Similar to a video type
					entry, you can play a rough-cut in the Vidiun Dynamic Player (VDP)
					- It can be a single or a mix of videos, a slide-show, a mix of
					both and much more.<br /> A rough-cut is an XML unique format
					invented by Vidiun, similar to Final Cut Pro 'Edit Decision List'
					but with a twist. Whenever a user uses the Vidiun Editor to create
					a mix of videos and images, in and out points, transitions, text
					overlays, soundtrack, effects and much more - the Vidiun Editor
					automatically saves this mix as a rough-cut. The user can then play
					the rough-cut in a Vidiun video player as if it was an ordinary
					(yet very cool) video.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td><a href="#widget">Widget</a></td>
				<td>A widget represents a Vidiun Dynamic Player (VDP) which is
					either bound to a specific media clip (in the case of media
					embedded in an external site) or a VDP that can show a gallery of
					media clips which can be selected via flashvars and javascript
					calls.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>VDP</td>
				<td>The Vidiun Dynamic Player (VDP) is a highly flexible media
					player allowing any developer to create his own skinned and
					customized version which may include different sets of components.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td>Contributor Wizard</td>
				<td>The Vidiun Contributor Wizard (aka CW or VCW) also known
					as the Vidiun Media Uploader, is a customizable wizard enabling
					end users to upload and import media. The wizard supports multiple
					file uploads, webcam and microphone recording and importing media
					from external sources (e.g. YouTube, Flickr, etc.). The wizard lets
					developers add their own media provider flex modules.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Standard Editor</td>
				<td>The Vidiun Standard Editor (aka SE or VSE) is a
					customizable flash video editor enabling end users to mash up
					videos and images, add audio tracks and enrich their video mix with
					transitions.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td><a href="#uiconf">UI Conf</a></td>
				<td>XML configuration file for various Vidiun components (VDP,
					VSE, VCW)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Partner</td>
				<td>An organization or individual that is authorized to access
					the APIs, and that has a Partner ID</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td><a href="#user">User (Partner user)</a></td>
				<td>Representation of a Partner's user in Vidiun's database</td>

						Delivery Network</a></td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<td>Notifications</td>
				<td>Sent by the Vidiun servers to a Partner system. These
					notifications enable a partner system to provide its own searching
					capabilities and caching for Vidiun stored data. The Vidiun
					servers log required operations and then send notifications
					asynchronously.</td>
